# The National Basketball Association (NBA) draft is annual event the NBA hosts to select the most promising basketball players in the world to join the league. In order to be draft eligible a player must be at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft, and be one year removed from their high school graduation. The first four - five picks of the draft are determined by a weighted lottery amongst the teams that didn't make the playoffs with the worst record having the highest weighted odds of receiving the top overall pick. All remaining picks are determined by their regular season record. 

# I think the NBA draft is an interesting parallel to graduate school admissions. Some baketball players didn't pursue any form of higher education and were ultimately successful in the NBA. For example, Lebron James was drafted out of high school and is now regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. However, Tim Duncan spent four years in college but has more championships than Lebron. This is similar to how some of our peers entered graduate school immediately upon completeing their undergraduate education, while we propel students did pursue further education.   

# In this analysis, I attempt to identify what the best place is to pursue your basketball education. 



# It should be noted that the 2012 and 2013 NBA draft data is missing.
