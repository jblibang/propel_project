#The NBA draft is annual event the NBA hosts to select the most promising basketball players in the world to join the league.
#In order to be draft eligible a player must be at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft, and be one year removed from their high school graduation. 
#The first four - five picks of the draft are determined by a weighted lottery amongst the teams that didn't make the playoffs with the worst record having the highest weighted odds of receiving the top overall pick. 
#All remaining picks are determined by their regular season record. 

#This 2012 and 2013 NBA draft data is missing. 

#I downloaded this data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball and I look specifically at the draft_history.csv
